I decided to throw out my old blog and build a new one that uses Github's
[pages](http://pages.github.com/). This new blog is pretty cool because it uses
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) to generate static html pages for
the site.

Jekyll is an interesting take on web sites. I don't know if it is a new idea,
but it is new to me. What Jekyll does is statically generate html pages using
the [Liquid](https://github.com/tobi/liquid) templating engine

I have migrated the posts which I found to be particularly interesting, but the
complete old blog can be found on [Blogger](http://eatnumber1.blogspot.com/)
