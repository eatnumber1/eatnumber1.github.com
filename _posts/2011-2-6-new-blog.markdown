title: New Blog
---

I decided to throw out my old blog and build a new one that uses Github's
[pages](http://pages.github.com/). This new blog is pretty cool because it uses
[jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) to generate static html pages for
the site.

I have migrated the posts which I found to be particularly interesting, but the
complete old blog can be found on [blogger](http://eatnumber1.blogger.com/)
