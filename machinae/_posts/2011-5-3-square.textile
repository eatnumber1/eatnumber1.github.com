A friend of mine introduced me to "Square":https://squareup.com. Square is a payment system where individuals or companies can accept credit card payments using an app on your iPhone or Android along with a special dongle.

The catch (and there always is one) is that _swiped_ card payments cost you an additional 2.75% processing fee by Square. That cost is taken out of the money being paid to you. It is possible to pass that cost on to your purchasers, however it is less than obvious to some exactly how to do it.

Your initial thought may be to just add 2.75% on to the amount. The problem with that is that the amount you add on will also be charged that 2.75% fee. Lets say for example, someone wants to pay you $1000.00. That means that Square will charge $27.50 for the transaction and you will get only $972.50. If you add on that $27.50 to the $1000.00, for a total of $1027.50, Square will then charge the 2.75% fee on the $1027.50 which will be a $28.25625 fee, leaving you with only $999.24375.[1] Oh no!

The actual percentage you need to charge those paying you in order to move the Square fee on to them can be calculated as follows: _x-0.0275x=y_ where _x_ is the amount the person will have to pay, and _y_ is the amount you actually want in your bank account. This can be rewritten as _x=1.02828y_ which means that the relationship between x and y is that x is 102.828% of y, or that x is 2.828% _higher_.[2]

The end result of all that math being that the magic percentage to add on to purchases to pass the Square fee off is *2.828%*. And in fact, the app has a handy little tax feature that if set to 2.828% will do all the math for you!

fn1. It is important to note that there might be slight discrepancies depending upon how Square goes about rounding values smaller than a cent.
