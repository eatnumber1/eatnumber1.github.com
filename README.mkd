This is the sources for my personal website.

There are two repositories for this website:
[rus.har.mn](https://github.com/eatnumber1/rus.har.mn), and
[eatnumber1.github.com](https://github.com/eatnumber1/eatnumber1.github.com).
eatnumber1.github.com is the jekyll generated sources for the website generated
from rus.har.mn. It is done this way to allow for the use of jekyll plugins.
